### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

* ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at Amazon Web Services in Load Balancer team. Me and my teammates are responsibles for Designing, Developing and Supportting Load Balancer Systems for Amazon Products and Services, which includes deep concepts of Networking applied to robust, scalable and high impact systems.  
* ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about **Cloud Computing Concepts**, **Distributed Systems** and curious about how **WEB 3.0** can impact how we, developers, use those concepts nowadays.
* ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Cloud Computing, because the best way to relaly learn is sharing what you think you learn ðŸ™‚
* ðŸ“Œ I'm originally from Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·. I'm living in Ireland ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡ª since 2022. And I've lived in Portugal ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹ in 2018. Boundaries are only a human invention ðŸ™‚

### Journey

<sub>The strikethrough only means that the technology you use does not changes your journey, your results talk for yourself. But do not get me wrong, quality is indispensable in anything you do and in anything you use.</sub>

**Studying**

I have started programming and became passionate by it in my teenager, when I was 16. Not satisfied with my learning curve, I started Computer Engineering in CEFET-MG where the more important thing for an engineer, *solve problems*. Because some good results in CEFET-MG, I also could study a period in Portugal in the University of Porto.

* Data Structures and Algorithms, Design Patterns, Operational Systems, Compilers, Distributted Systems, ~~C, C++, Pyton, Machine Learning, OpenGL~~.

**Working**

Back from Portugal, my first job was an Internship in TAKE BLIP. There, I worked for 4 years, from Intern to *Operations TechLead* and learned that *problems are solved from people to people*.

More recently, I have started working for Amazon Web Services. So, putting things together, and I'm glad to have the oportunity to *solve hard problems that will impact people* in a global scale ðŸ™‚

* ~~Azure, AWS, AKS, Docker, Kubernetes, DynamoDB, SQL, Java, C#, JavaScript, React~~

**Passion**

Beyond writing code, I'm passionate for the High Level solutions of what I'm writing, and that's why I'm an enthusiast to Cloud Computing and Distributed Systems, every line of code has a high level purpose that impacts a component, which in turn interacts with another component and finally solves a real problem. 


### Beyond code

As a good Brazilian, I'm a big football fan. Football taght me things that I consider fundamental in our lifes, including work, and sometimes, we need years to learn, like **Leadership**, **Teamwork**, **Competition**, **Results**... and the list goes on. And I like sports in general ðŸ™‚

Finally, I like learning, about anything. Because that, sometimes you'll see me somehow out of coding context, and I'll be Playing Guitar, Traveling, Practicing Language, Reading Geopolitics, Investing... and the list also goes on.
